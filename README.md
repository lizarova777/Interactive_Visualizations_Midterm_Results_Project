# Interactive Visualization

Interactive visualization is becoming a more prominent feature of reporting. Business analytics packages tend to stress the ease eith which data can be played with by non-experts. Allowing students to explore aspects of complex data rather than simply telling them what you see can be a powerful tool for learning as explored in the readings. Within the RStudio universe this functionality is accomplished through the Shiny ecosystem. A web-app designing interface that allows web-apps to be built from within R with limited knowledge of javascript or html.

## Project Objective:

The purpose of this project is to build a couple of basic Shiny Apps and then  create an interactive visualization of some midterm test data that can aid student learning. This visualization consists of skill mastery for each student based on the midterm results, which can be seen below. The skills are as follows: coding, decision trees, just-in-time-learning (JITL), neural networks, natural language processing (NLP), social network analysis (SNA), substantive meaning from the analysis (Substantive), data visualizations (Viz), and data wrangling. 


## Datasets:

  * midterm-results.csv
  * quiz-categories.csv
      * wrangling - Question required data manipulations skills  
      * coding - Question required coding skills  
      * d.trees - Question invoilved decision trees  
      * sna - Question involved social network analysis  
      * nlp - Question involved natural language processing  
      * viz - Question involved visualization of data  
      * n.nets - Question involved neural nets  
      * googleable - Question could be answered by searching the internet  
      * non-googleable - Question could not be answered through simple searching of the internet  
      * jitl - Question involved learning somethimg new (just in time learning)  
      * substantive - Question involved wrestling with a complex idea that does not have a definitive answer
